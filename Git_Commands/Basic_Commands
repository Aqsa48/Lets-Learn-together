If you want only the remote URL, or if your are not connected to a network that can reach the remote repo:
git config --get remote.origin.url

If you require full output and you are on a network that can reach the remote repo where the origin resides :
git remote show origin

**seting up your new url**
 git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Aqsa48/GitHubFinder.git
